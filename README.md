# Rest-web-service

For this exercice I have tried two languages : Ruby and Python.

With Ruby I used Rails and I manage to create a basic functional API.

With Python I used Flask and sqlachemy and even if the Api doesn't work yet, except for the 'export' method, I thinck I'm much closer to what is reqested than with Rails.

You can find the two approaches in this repo.
